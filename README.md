# Generative AI Code Repository

This repository contains code for various Generative AI models and techniques, including but not limited to:

- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Auto-regressive models (e.g., LSTM-based)
- Transformer-based architectures (e.g., GPT, BERT)
- Self-attention mechanisms
- Image-to-Image translation
- Text-to-Image synthesis
- Style Transfer

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/generative-ai-repo.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies.

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the desired script or Jupyter notebook for the specific model or technique you're interested in.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to run specific models or techniques:

### Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

#### Image Reconstruction

To reconstruct images using a pre-trained VAE model:

```shell
python vae_reconstruction.py --input_path path/to/input/image.jpg
```

### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

#### Image Generation

To generate images using a pre-trained GAN model:

```shell
python gan_generation.py --output_path path/to/output/image.jpg
```

### Auto-regressive Models

#### Text Generation

To generate text using a pre-trained LSTM-based model:

```shell
python lstm_text_generation.py --output_length 100
```

### Transformer-based Architectures

#### Image-to-Image Translation

To translate images from one domain to another using a pre-trained CycleGAN model:

```shell
python cyclegan_translation.py --input_path path/to/input/image.jpg --output_domain b
```
